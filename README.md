# erli

**erli** is an Erlang based URL shortener. It comes in two parts, the frontend, which is written in angular.js and the backend, based on webmachine.

It is also a more involved experiment with both REST and webmachine as an abstraction of it. **erli** comes with custom URLs, simple statistics for each shortened URL and optional landing pages (that include screenshots of the target website).
